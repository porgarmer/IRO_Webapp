    <div class="section">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Island Rescue Organization (IRO)</strong> is a non-profit and non-government organization committed to the rescue, care, and advocacy for animals in the region. Founded in 2010, IRO has become a beacon of hope for stray and abandoned animals through its core pillars: <strong>Rescue, Education, and Advocacy</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past decade, IRO has built a strong foundation of community partnerships, engaging volunteers, private sector organizations, and local government units (LGUs) in their mission to create a safe haven for animals.

    <!-- Shelters Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Our Shelters</h2>
        <p>
            IRO currently operates three dedicated shelters that provide a safe and nurturing environment for animals in need:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Barili Shelter:</strong> A sanctuary for senior and special-needs dogs.</li>
            <li><strong>Mandaue Shelter:</strong> A space designed for cats, including those with special medical needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cebu City Shelter (Brgy. Guba):</strong> The primary shelter housing the majority of rescued animals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These shelters are run solely by volunteers, and each plays a vital role in improving the lives of animals while preparing them for rehoming or ensuring they are cared for throughout their lives.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Community Impact Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Our Impact</h2>
        <p>
            With over 100 animals currently under its care, IRO relies on the generosity of sponsors and donors to cover essential costs, including food, veterinary care, and day-to-day operations. Annual projects and fundraising initiatives also enable IRO to sustain its mission while spreading awareness about responsible pet ownership and animal welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
            The organization continues to advocate for long-term solutions, such as spaying and neutering programs, to address the growing stray animal population while improving their quality of life.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Vision Section -->
    <div class="vision">
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            To create a society where animal rescue organizations are no longer needed, and all living beings are treated with dignity and respect. IRO envisions a world where humans and animals coexist in harmony, fostering a sustainable and compassionate environment for future generations.
